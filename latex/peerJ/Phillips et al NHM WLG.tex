\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:} With the increase in human population, the ability to predict biodiversity loss or gain as a result of land use change within an urban settings is important. Most models that link biodiversity and land use are at the wrong scale for  informing policy decisions, especially those related planning applications. Using the grounds of the Natural History Museum, London, as a case study, we show how methods used in global models can be applied to smaller spatial scales to influence urban planning. 

\textbf{Methods:} Data were extracted from relevant primary literature where species richness had been recorded in more than one habitat type within an urban setting. As within-sample species richness will increase with habitat area, species richness estimates were also converted to species density using theory based on the species area relationship. Mixed effects models were used to model the impact on species richness and species density of different habitat types, in the current grounds and in the proposed plans. Using the two models three assumptions on how within-sample diversity scales with habitat area were tested. A pre-existing plant database was also utilised to determine changes in species composition across different habitats.

\textbf{Results:} Analysis showed that the proposed plans could result in a net biodiversity increase of 14.05\% across the NHM grounds, when local species richness was modelled. The least optimist result showed only an 11.17\% increase in biodiversity, when species density was the response metric, and changes in habitat area were accounted for. Plant community composition was relatively similar between the habitats currently within the grounds.

\textbf{Discussion:} The proposed plans to the NHM grounds are estimated to result in a net gain in biodiversity, most likely due to the increased number of habitats, as well as the increased area of each habitat. Overall, downscaling of methods from other global models was successful, and produced results that are able to inform local decisions. Although the method does rely on data being available, which for some comparisons was harder than others. Additionally, as data were too sparse to model how biodiversity varies after habitat disturbance and creation, this would need to be taken in account in future studies.
