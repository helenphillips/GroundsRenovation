Theory predicts that species density should scale with fragment area at a slope of 0.01, however, previous analysis has shown that the slope was 0.07 (95\% confidence interval: 0.048 - 0.11), thus the analysis was repeated with z = 0.07.  Species density (per 10m\textsuperscript{2}) significantly varied between habitat types ($\chi^2$ = 377.23, d.f. = 12, p < 0.01).  Assumption 1 yields an increase of 12.17\%. Under Assumption 2, the increase is estimated to be 13.5\%.
